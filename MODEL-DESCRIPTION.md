# Granite-TimeSeries-TTM-R2 Model Card

## ChronoAPI integration

This repository ships **ChronoAPI**, a FastAPI service that uses IBM Granite **granite-tsfm** to load and run TTM models. For how to run, configure, and deploy the API, see the main [README.md](README.md).

| Topic | How ChronoAPI uses TTM-R2 |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Default model ID | `ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2` (see [`app/model.py`](app/model.py)) |
| Default context / horizon | Context length **512**, prediction length **96** (configurable per request where the stack allows) |
| Inference input | Multivariate windows: timestamp column **`date`**, targets **`HUFL`**, **`HULL`**, **`MUFL`**, **`MULL`**, **`LUFL`**, **`LULL`**, **`OT`** (see [`app/services/constants.py`](app/services/constants.py) and [`app/schemas/requests.py`](app/schemas/requests.py)) |
| Preprocessing | The service builds tensors from the recent context window; see the docstring in [`app/services/forecast.py`](app/services/forecast.py) for how this relates to `TimeSeriesPreprocessor` and scaling expectations from the model card below. |
| Tests / CI | Set **`SKIP_MODEL_LOAD=1`** to use a dummy PyTorch module so tests do not download weights. |

The remainder of this document is the **TTM-R2 model card** (IBM Research). It describes model capabilities, training data, and recommended use; ChronoAPI is a thin serving layer on top of the same Hugging Face model family.

TinyTimeMixers (TTMs) are compact pre-trained models for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting, open-sourced by IBM Research. 
**With model sizes starting from 1M params, TTM (accepted in NeurIPS 24) introduces the notion of the first-ever “tiny” pre-trained models for Time-Series Forecasting.** 


TTM outperforms several popular benchmarks demanding billions of parameters in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting. TTMs are lightweight 
forecasters, pre-trained on publicly available time series data with various augmentations. TTM provides state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasts and can easily be 
fine-tuned for multi-variate forecasts with just 5% of the training data to be competitive.  Refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf) for more details.


**The current open-source version supports point forecasting use-cases specifically ranging from minutely to hourly resolutions 
(Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.).**

**Note that zeroshot, fine-tuning and inference tasks using TTM can easily be executed in 1 GPU machine or in laptops too!!**


**TTM-R2 comprises TTM variants pre-trained on larger pretraining datasets (~700M samples).** We have another set of TTM models released under `TTM-R1` trained on ~250M samples 
which can be accessed from [here](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1). In general, `TTM-R2` models perform better than `TTM-R1` models as they are 
trained on larger pretraining dataset. In standard benchmarks, TTM-R2 outperform TTM-R1 by over 15%.  However, the choice of R1 vs R2 depends on your target data distribution. Hence requesting users to try both
R1 and R2 variants and pick the best for your data.



## Model Description

TTM falls under the category of “focused pre-trained models”, wherein each pre-trained TTM is tailored for a particular forecasting 
setting (governed by the context length and forecast length). Instead of building one massive model supporting all forecasting settings, 
we opt for the approach of constructing smaller pre-trained models, each focusing on a specific forecasting setting, thereby 
yielding more accurate results. Furthermore, this approach ensures that our models remain extremely small and exceptionally fast, 
facilitating easy deployment without demanding a ton of resources. 

Hence, in this model card, we release several pre-trained 
TTMs that can cater to many common forecasting settings in practice. 

Each pre-trained model will be released in a different branch name in this model card. Kindly access the required model using our 
getting started [notebook](https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/notebooks/hfdemo/ttm_getting_started.ipynb) mentioning the branch name.

## Model Releases:

Given the variety of models included, please use the [[get_model]](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm/blob/main/tsfm_public/toolkit/get_model.py) utility to automatically select the required model based on your input context length and forecast length requirement.

There are several models available in different branches of this model card. The naming scheme follows the following format:
`<context length>-<prediction length>-<frequency prefix tuning indicator>-<pretraining metric>-<release number>`

 - context length: The historical data used as input to the TTM model.

 - prediction length: The number of time points predicted by model (i.e., the forecast length)

 - frequency tuning indicator ("ft" or missing): "ft" is used to indicate use of frequency prefix tuning. When enabled an extra embedding vector indicating the frequency of the data is added to the input of the model. If missing, only the context window is used by the model.

 - pretraining metric ("mae" or missing): MAE indicates pertaining with mean absolute error loss, while missing indicates using mean squared error.

 - release number ("r2" or "r2.1"): Indicates the model release; the release indicates which data was used to train the model. See "training data" below for more details on the data included in the particular training datasets.

## Benchmarks

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="benchmarks.webp" width="600">
</p>

TTM outperforms popular benchmarks such as TimesFM, Moirai, Chronos, Lag-Llama, Moment, GPT4TS, TimeLLM, LLMTime in zero/fewshot forecasting while reducing computational requirements significantly. 
Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider
adoption in resource-constrained environments. For more details, refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf).
- TTM-B referred in the paper maps to the 512 context models.
- TTM-E referred in the paper maps to the 1024 context models.
- TTM-A referred in the paper maps to the 1536 context models.

Please note that the Granite TTM models are pre-trained exclusively on datasets
with clear commercial-use licenses that are approved by our legal team. As a result, the pre-training dataset used in this release differs slightly from the one used in the research
paper, which may lead to minor variations in model performance as compared to the published results. Please refer to our paper for more details.

**Benchmarking Scripts: [here](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm/tree/main/notebooks/hfdemo/tinytimemixer/full_benchmarking)**

## Recommended Use
1. Users have to externally standard scale their data independently for every channel before feeding it to the model (Refer to [TSP](https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/tsfm_public/toolkit/time_series_preprocessor.py), our data processing utility for data scaling.)
2. The current open-source version supports only minutely and hourly resolutions(Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.). Other lower resolutions (say weekly, or monthly) are currently not supported in this version, as the model needs a minimum context length of 512 or 1024.
3. Enabling any upsampling or prepending zeros to virtually increase the context length for shorter-length datasets is not recommended and will
   impact the model performance. 



## Model Details

For more details on TTM architecture and benchmarks, refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf).

TTM-1 currently supports 2 modes:

 - **Zeroshot forecasting**: Directly apply the pre-trained model on your target data to get an initial forecast (with no training).

 - **Finetuned forecasting**: Finetune the pre-trained model with a subset of your target data to further improve the forecast.

**Since, TTM models are extremely small and fast, it is practically very easy to finetune the model with your available target data in few minutes 
to get more accurate forecasts.**

The current release supports multivariate forecasting via both channel independence and channel-mixing approaches. 
Decoder Channel-Mixing can be enabled during fine-tuning for capturing strong channel-correlation patterns across 
time-series variates, a critical capability lacking in existing counterparts.

In addition, TTM also supports exogenous infusion and static categorical data infusion.

## Uses


Automatic Model selection
```
def get_model(
    model_path,
    model_name: str = "ttm",
    context_length: int = None,
    prediction_length: int = None,
    freq_prefix_tuning: bool = None,
    **kwargs,
):
    
    TTM Model card offers a suite of models with varying context_length and forecast_length combinations.
    This wrapper automatically selects the right model based on the given input context_length and prediction_length abstracting away the internal
    complexity.

    Args:
        model_path (str):
            HF model card path or local model path (Ex. ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1)
        model_name (*optional*, str)
            model name to use. Allowed values: ttm
        context_length (int):
            Input Context length. For ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1, we allow 512 and 1024.
            For ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2 and  ibm/ttm-research-r2, we allow 512, 1024 and 1536
        prediction_length (int):
            Forecast length to predict. For ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1, we can forecast upto 96.
            For ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2 and  ibm/ttm-research-r2, we can forecast upto 720.
            Model is trained for fixed forecast lengths (96,192,336,720) and this model add required `prediction_filter_length` to the model instance for required pruning.
            For Ex. if we need to forecast 150 timepoints given last 512 timepoints using model_path = ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2, then get_model will select the
            model from 512_192_r2 branch and applies prediction_filter_length = 150 to prune the forecasts from 192 to 150. prediction_filter_length also applies loss
            only to the pruned forecasts during finetuning.
        freq_prefix_tuning (*optional*, bool):
            Future use. Currently do not use this parameter.
        kwargs:
            Pass all the extra fine-tuning model parameters intended to be passed in the from_pretrained call to update model configuration.
